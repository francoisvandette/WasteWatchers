# WasteWatchers
 Helps users track expiry dates for their food. Uses HTML/CSS/JS for client side, and Java Servlets and MySQL for Backend.

Notes: Run the Java Servlets using Tomcat 9. Uses MySQL as the database, and requires running the 'Database_Definition.sql' file in MySQL before the app will work.
